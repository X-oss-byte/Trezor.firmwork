# External repositories

## fido2-tests
This repository contains a test suite for FIDO2, U2F, and other security key functions.

## libopencm3
An open-source firmware library designed for various ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. We utilize this library specifically for products based on STM32F2 devices, with the current application limited to the T1 model.

## micropython
Micropython is a project aimed at implementing Python 3.x on microcontrollers and small embedded systems.

## nanopb
This is a compact Protocol Buffers implementation written in ANSI C. It is particularly suitable for microcontrollers but can be used in any memory-constrained system.

## QR-Code-generator
This repository houses a QR Code generator library.

## secp256k1-zkp
secp256k1-zkp is an optimized C library tailored for ECDSA signatures and secret/public key operations on the secp256k1 curve.

## stm32u5-cmsis-device
The STM32U5 CMSIS device module for the STM32U5 family of microcontrollers.

## stm32u5-hal-drivers
This repository contains STM32U5 HAL/LL (Hardware Abstraction Layer/Low-Level) drivers developed for the STM32U5 family.

## stm32xx-lib
This repository holds a portion of STMicroelectronics' STM32 Cube firmware library.
It's maintaned by MicroPython team and it is quite outdated. We use this library for products based on STM32F4xx devices, currently limited to the T model.
